This directory contains the files for the Energy Policy version of "Green Exports and the Global Product Space." 

The original code for the original version of the paper can be found in ~/Documents/trade_data

All analysis was done in R unless otherwise noted. 

SYSTEM SPECIFICATION:
AMD Phenom II X4 3.2 ghz
16gb RAM
nVidia 9500 gpu
R v2.13.0 compiled vs. GOTO BLAS


The replication files are as follows:

1. calculate_rca.R
   Provides the RCA calculations for the UN COMTRADE data
2. calculate_prox.R
   Calculates the proximity spaces based on the COMTRADE RCA calculations
3. summarize_prox.R
   Averages proximity files over years to get stable product spaces
4. plot_product_space.py
   Generates the product space representation of the proximity matrix and plots
   using the networkx libraries for python
5. construct_model_matrix.R
   Constructs the model matrix used for the figures and linear regressions. Merges in data on market size as 
   described in the text
6. analyze_model_matrix.R
   Performs regressions as described in the text; generates output tables and figures

The file replicate.R will run all of these files in sequence if desired. The working directory
in that file should be changed to reflect the user's directory structure. It assumes the following 
hierarchy:

./code          Location of all .R and .py files
./data          Location of all data
./figures       Location of all figures
./scripts       Location of some helper scripts for data acquisition, not run by replicate.R
                get_bulk_trade_data.R: scripts download of COMTRADE data
                reformat_comtrade_list.R: reformats country data into sensible structure
                write_yearly_files.R: outputs yearly (rather than country-wise) COMTRADE files

replicate.R defines some defaults that are used in all scripts; if you run the scripts independently, they will
go looking for those values.
